# Node.js Application Deployment on AWS ECS Fargate using Terraform

This project deploys a Node.js application to an Amazon ECS Fargate cluster managed by Terraform. This serverless approach leverages AWS infrastructure for scalability and ease of management.

## Deployment Steps

The deployment process follows these steps:

1.  **Application Development and Build:** Develop the Node.js application and define its build process (e.g., using npm or yarn).
2.  **Dockerization:** Create a Dockerfile to build a container image based on the application's build process.  This image includes all necessary dependencies.
3.  **Docker Compose (Optional): Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to define the application and its dependencies (e.g., a database image). This step simplifies local development and testing.
4.  **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Setup:** Initialize a Terraform project. Configure remote state management (e.g., using an S3 bucket for state file persistence) and define necessary AWS providers.
5.  **Network Infrastructure:**  Create Terraform configuration to provision the following VPC resources:
    *   Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
    *   Subnets (public and private)
    *   Internet Gateway (if required for public access)
    *   Route Tables
    *   NAT Gateway (for outbound internet access from private subnets)
    *   NAT instances (if NAT Gateway is not sufficient)
    *   VPC Endpoints (for secure access to AWS services)
6.  **Bastion Host (Optional):**  If SSH access is required for maintenance, provision a bastion host EC2 instance with appropriate security groups.
7.  **Security Groups:** Define security groups to control network access to the application and database.
8.  **ECR Setup:** Create an Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repository to store the Docker image.
9.  **ECS Cluster and Task Definition:**  Use Terraform to define the ECS Fargate cluster and the task definition for the application, specifying container port mappings, resource allocation, and other necessary configurations.
10. **RDS PostgreSQL:** Provision an RDS PostgreSQL instance using Terraform, configuring appropriate settings for security and performance.
11. **Deployment:** Deploy the application using Terraform. This includes pushing the Docker image to ECR and creating the ECS service.
